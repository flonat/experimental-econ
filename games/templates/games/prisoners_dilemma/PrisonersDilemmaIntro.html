<p>Welcome to the Prisoner’s Dilemma Game! (whether it's your first, second, or even third time playing)</p>
<br>
<p>In this game, you will be paired with another participant. Both of you will make decisions without knowing what the other person chooses. Here’s how it works:</p>
<br>
<b>Scenario:</b>
<p>Imagine that you and another participant have been arrested for a minor crime. The police suspect you of a more serious crime but lack sufficient evidence. They offer you both a deal:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>If both of you cooperate (stay silent)</strong>: You both receive a light sentence of 1 year in prison.</li>
    <li><strong>If one of you defects (betrays the other) while the other cooperates</strong>: The betrayer goes free, and the cooperator receives a heavy sentence of 5 years in prison.</li>
    <li><strong>If both of you defect (betray each other)</strong>: You both receive a moderate sentence of 3 years in prison.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your Choices:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cooperate</strong>: Stay silent.</li>
    <li><strong>Defect</strong>: Betray the other participant.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will make your choice without knowing what the other participant decides. The outcome depends on the combination of both choices.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Both Cooperate</strong>: 1 year each.</li>
    <li><strong>One Defects</strong>, One Cooperates: Betrayer goes free, cooperator gets 5 years.</li>
    <li><strong>Both Defect</strong>: 3 years each.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Decide whether to cooperate or defect, considering the potential outcomes.</p>
<p>Remember, the other participant faces the same dilemma. After making your choice, you will see the outcome based on your and the other participant’s choices.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Take a moment to think about your strategy.</li>
    <li>Make your choice within the given time frame.</li>
    <li>Reflect on the outcome after each round.</li>
    <li>Good luck, and think strategically!</li>
</ul>
